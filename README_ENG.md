## Welcome by Blue Horizn

### who we are?

We at Blue Horizn are a freshly founded start-up that currently only consists of the three of us. We have the philosophy of software that make your day easier without costing a lot. Because if we are completely affordable, good cheap software is in short supply at the current time.

Each of us started to deal with software and hardware at a very young age and already there we were often forced to fall back on illegally provided software packages by usury prices.
We hope to be able to make you satisfied with our products and to have freed you from the miserable search for good offers for software that is far too expensive.
